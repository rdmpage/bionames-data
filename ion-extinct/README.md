# Notes on flagging extinct taxa


## PaleoDB errors

Doesn't have Notoungulata as extinct

But see https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicTaxonInfo?taxon_no=43320 ?!?

UPDATE names SET extinct="Y", extinct_source="wikipedia" WHERE `group`="Notoungulata";

Flags "Natantia" as extinct (prawns!!)

OK, there is also a "Natantia" in the mammals, see http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon_no=86538
